# Welcome to Sutil Domain Form
Form that only outputs a valid domain instance

## Why Sutil ? 
It is likely that you have never heard of or used Sutil before, so I would like to empathize with you as to why I have developed a package on top of this new framework.

Instead of familiarity or popularity, I choose a frontend framework based on criteria.
My list of criteria was as follows: 
* __Robust__: Elm is know for beeing robust. This is done with a pure functional language, strong types, and a robusst predictable pattern.
* __Reactive__: SolidJS and Svelte is examples of frameworks that embrace observables to makeing dom manipulation much more efficient, robust and predictable, that virtual doms and other method i have seen.
* __Html is returned by function__: ReactJS, SolidJS and Elm all shares that you can use normal syntax to generate Html. No need for a new template language with "__diffrent__" syntax and possibilities.
* __Backend integration__: The ability to share functions and types between the client and server, such as Blazor, full-stack JS frameworks, makes the development process more enjoyable.

From these criterias, I found that Sutil to be the optimal solution. Is it perfect? Nope, and here is some of the drawbacks: 
* __Matureaty__: The framework just finished the beta state. The comunity is relativ small and there is no big company investet in it.
* __Ecosystem__: It is based on Fable, but most other tools build in Fable is targeted another framwork (React based). It does not have the nice package manager from Elm and so on. 
* __Observable Syntax__ : Svelte made the observable syntax close to invisable, this is not the case in Sutil. Sutil is closer to RXJS.

## What can the form do for me ?

## Getting started
In the future...
```
dotnet add package Sutil.Domain.Form
```
